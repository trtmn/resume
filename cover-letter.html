      <p>Dear Hiring Team,</p>

      <p>Thank you for considering my application for the Senior Technology Support Associate position. I’m drawn to The Trevor Project’s mission and values, and I’d be grateful for the opportunity to contribute to the essential work you’re doing.</p>

      <p>In my previous roles at Apple, SurveyMonkey, and mmhmm, I’ve supported a wide range of technical environments—including macOS, iOS, and internal platforms—and worked closely with engineering, IT, and support teams to troubleshoot issues, improve documentation, and smooth out the user experience. I’ve also helped train team members and have contributed to creating support materials and internal video resources.</p>

      <p>I enjoy solving problems collaboratively, digging into root causes, and finding small ways to improve workflows and reduce friction. I try to bring patience, curiosity, and attention to detail to each support request, whether it’s resolving an issue directly or helping to guide it to the right person.</p>

      <p>The Trevor Project’s commitment to helping keep LGBTQ+ youth safe and connected is something I care deeply about. I’d be proud to support the staff and volunteers who make that possible by helping ensure the tools and systems they rely on are dependable and easy to use. I hope to bring my experience in tech support, QA, and internal tooling to that work—and keep learning along the way.</p>

      <p>Thank you again for your time and consideration.</p>

      <p>Sincerely,<br>Matt Troutman</p>
