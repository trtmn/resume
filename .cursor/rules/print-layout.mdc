# Print and Layout Guide for Resume

- The resume must always fit on a single printed page (US Letter).
- Use the "Noto Sans" font from Google Fonts as the primary typeface.
- All sections, including bullet points and skills, should be presented in a single column for print.
- Prevent page or column breaks within section headers (`h3`) and job headers (`.jobheader`).
- Maintain compact vertical spacing throughout, but ensure extra space below section headers, job headers, between bullet points, and between main sections for clarity.
- Keep the header and resume body together; avoid page breaks immediately after the header.
- All print-specific CSS is in `master.css`, using `@media print` queries.
- The HTML structure is defined in `index.html`.
